# Magnify Cash | MAG Token & Bridges

## Installation

Prerequisites: `NodeJS` version 16 or higher, `npm` version 7 or higher.

üìù _`NodeJS` version **`v20.9.0`** (LTS) and `npm` version **`10.1.0`** were used for development_.

Run the command `$ npm install` in [the root of the project directory](./) to install all the dependencies specified in [`package.json`](./package.json), compile contracts ([`contracts/`](./contracts/)), prepare an ABI ([`abi/`](./abi/)), documentation ([`docs/`](./docs/)) for the contracts in [the NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) and [Husky hooks](#husky-hooks).

## Testing

Run `$ npm run dev:coverage` to examine how well the developed tests cover the functionality of contracts. The results can also be viewed in a web browser by opening a file [`coverage/index.html`](./coverage/index.html) created by the script.

Perform tests with `$ npm test` to run all tests from the [`test/`](./test/) directory.

Use `$ npm run test-t` to see events and calls when running tests, or `$ npm run test-ft` to also see the storage operations.

üìù _Each test case (`it()`) of [`tests/`](./test/) is independent due to isolation using [a fixture](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/reference#fixtures), [a snapshot](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/reference#snapshots) or `beforeEach()`, so the entire specific flow is contained in `it()` and a set of `before()` and `beforeEach()` before it._

### Test coverage results

| File           | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| MAGToken.sol   | 100     | 100      | 100     | 100     |

| NFTYBridge.sol | 100     | 98.75    | 100     | 100     |

## Utilities

-   `$ npm run dev:docs` to generate a documentation for contracts. _The documentation is generated for all contracts in the directory [`contracts/`](./contracts/) to the directory [`docs/`](./docs/) using [the NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html). It uses the OpenZeppelin's documentation generation library [solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen)._

## Troubleshooting

Use `$ npm run clean` and try again.

## Environment setup

Before running scripts for deployment or making snapshots it is important to set up all keys. In file [`.env.example`](./.env.example) there are all variables that must be copy and set in file [`.env`].

### Short description:

-   SEPOLIA_URL, AMOY_URL, BNB_TESTNET_URL, BASE_TESTNET_URL: These are URLs for different test networks. They are currently commented out, but can be uncommented and set to the appropriate URLs for testing purposes.
-   MAINNET_URL, POLYGON_MAINNET_URL, BNB_MAINNET_URL, BASE_MAINNET_URL: These are URLs for different mainnet networks. They are currently commented out, but can be uncommented and set to the appropriate URLs for interacting with live networks.
-   PRIVATE_KEY: This is the private key for the sender account. It is currently set to an empty string, but should be replaced with a valid private key. All deployments and scripts that can be running, will be done from this private key.
-   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY, POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY, BNBSCAN_API_KEY, BASE_API_KEY: These are API keys for different block explorers. They are currently commented out, but can be uncommented and set to the appropriate keys for interacting with the respective block explorers. Required for verification smart contracts.
-   MORALIS_API_KEY: This is the API key for the Moralis service. It is currently set to a placeholder value, but should be replaced with a valid API key. Required for making snapshots of the tokens of chains.

## NFTY Bridge

### Overview

The NFTYBridge contract serves as a bridge between two chains, allowing the transfer of tokens between them. It includes functionalities for initializing the contract, transferring tokens between chains, and managing whitelisted addresses.

Functions `setWhitelisted` and `setAllocations` are responsible for allowing only specific users to call `send` function. It is also allow transfer only specific amount of tokens based on snapshot of the token.

### Pause controller

NFTY Bridge contract allows set pause on `send` function or allow to call `emergencyWithdraw` function.

## MAG Bridge

The MAG Bridge is the second part of the bridge and was developed for receiving tokens on BASE network. The main difference between NFTY and MAG bridge is that `send`, `refund` and `blockRefund` functions are not exist. For receiving tokens there is a function `withdraw` and available only for relayer.

### Withdraw

The `withdraw` function is used to send tokens to receiver from event on NFTY bridge contract. It initiates the transfer of tokens from relayer address.

function `withdraw(address token, address to, uint256 amount, string calldata nonceOnOtherChain) external whenNotPaused onlyRole(RELAYER_ROLE) onlySupportedToken(token)`

Description: Sends tokens from the contract to receiver.

-   token: Address of the token to be transferred.
-   to: Address to which the tokens should be sent on the other chain.
-   amount: Amount of tokens to be transferred.
-   nonceOnOtherChain: Nonce that was generated on NFTY bridge to track all sends

Requirements

-   The token must be supported by the bridge contract.
-   The sender must be relayer
-   Contract must be on unpause state
-   The contract must have enough tokens to transfer.

Modifiers

-   only for relayers

Events

-   `Withdraw(token, otherChainToken[token], to, amount, nonceOnOtherChain)`: Indicates the success of transferring tokens to receiver.

### Rest of the functions

Rest of the function are the same as in NFTY bridge contract. It also has function for manage tokens (add and remove) and withdrawing tokens from the contract (emergency withdraw), except functions for managing whitelisted users. Support pause and unpause.

## MAG Token

Here's the refined documentation for the `MAGToken` contract, combining clarity, technical details, and user-friendliness:

**MAGToken Contract Documentation**

**Overview**

-   **Token Name:** MAG Token (MAG)
-   **Standard:** ERC20 (with extensions)
-   **Key Features:**
    -   Pausable: Token transfers can be temporarily halted by authorized administrators.
    -   Role-Based Access: Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for managing permissions.
    -   Permit: Allows for gas-efficient token approvals through off-chain signatures.
    -   Bridge Integration: Special privileges for a designated bridge contract during paused states.

**Contract Details**

-   **Deployment:**

    -   Initial total supply (`_totalSupply`) is minted to the deployer's address.
    -   The deployer is assigned the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `PAUSER_ROLE`.
    -   A bridge address (`_bridge`) must be provided during deployment and is assigned the `BRIDGE_ROLE`.

-   **Roles:**

    -   `PAUSER_ROLE`: Authorized to pause and unpause token transfers.
    -   `BRIDGE_ROLE`: Allowed to transfer tokens even when the contract is paused.
    -   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Has full administrative privileges over the contract (implicitly includes `PAUSER_ROLE`).

-   **Functions:**

    -   **`pause()`:** Pauses all token transfers (except for the bridge). Requires `PAUSER_ROLE`.
    -   **`unpause()`:** Resumes token transfers. Requires `PAUSER_ROLE`.
    -   **`_beforeTokenTransfer()` (internal):**
        -   Overridden to implement the bridge exception during paused states.
        -   If paused, only the bridge or contract owner can transfer tokens.

**Errors:**

-   **`ZeroAddress()`:** Thrown if the bridge address provided during deployment is invalid (zero address).
-   **`OnlyBridgeCanTransfer()`:** Thrown if a non-bridge or non-admin account attempts to transfer tokens while the contract is paused.

**Usage Notes**

-   **Security:** The contract is not upgradable. Carefully audit and test before deployment.
-   **Pause Functionality:** Use the pause/unpause features cautiously in case of emergencies or vulnerabilities.
-   **Bridge Integration:** The bridge integration allows for cross-chain transfers even when the token is paused, which might be useful for certain scenarios but should be considered carefully from a security perspective.

## Snapshots creation

**Token Holder Data Retrieval Script**

**Overview**

This script utilizes the Moralis API to fetch token holder data from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum Mainnet (ETH) and Polygon for a specific ERC20 token. It then filters the data and saves it to a JSON file.

**Prerequisites**

-   **Moralis API Key:** Obtain an API key from Moralis and store it in a `.env` file at the root of your project as `MORALIS_API_KEY`.

**Configuration**

-   **Token Address (Line 10)**: Already set corresponding to the file name and chain to run the script.
-   **Pages (Line 25)**: Change the value of `pages` to adjust the number of holder pages to fetch. Each page fetches a maximum of 100 holders (12,600 holders in this case). This is crucial part, making mistake may cause problems in future calculation amount for sending to bridge and total supply of the token, users will not get more tokens that they should, but it is better to make this step correctly. In order to see go to the explorer of the chain and search for the amount of token holders.

**Execution**

Each network must be run separately

1. Ethereum mainnet

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/snapshots/snapshotEthereum.ts
```

2. Binance smart chain

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/snapshots/snapshotBsc.ts
```

3. Polygon

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/snapshots/snapshotPolygon.ts
```

**Output**

The script will create a file named `tokenHoldersBsc.json`, `tokenHoldersEthereum.json` and `tokenHoldersPolygon.json` in the same directory. This file will contain a JSON array with the following structure for each holder:

```json
[
    {
        "walletAddress": "0x...",
        "balance": "..."
    },
    {
        "walletAddress": "0x...",
        "balance": "..."
    }
]
```

-   `walletAddress`: The Ethereum address of the token holder.
-   `balance`: The holder's balance of the specified token.

**Explanation**

1. **Import and Setup:** Imports required libraries and initializes Moralis with the API key.
2. **Data Fetching:**
    - Iterates through a specified number of pages.
    - Fetches token owners from Moralis's EVM API for the given token address on the BSC.
    - Uses cursors to retrieve subsequent pages.
3. **Data Filtering:**
    - Extracts wallet addresses and balances from the raw Moralis response.
    - Creates a simplified JSON array for easier use.
4. **Output:**
    - Writes the filtered data to a JSON file.

**Important Notes:**

-   **Rate Limits:** Be aware of Moralis API rate limits to avoid errors.
-   **Data Accuracy:** Data from blockchain APIs can sometimes be delayed or incomplete. Always double-check critical information.
-   **Environment Variables:** Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured with your Moralis API key.

## MAG Bridge deployment

-   FIRST TRY TO RUN SCRIPTS ON TESTNETS

**MAGBridge Contract Deployment and Verification Script**

**Purpose**

This script automates the deployment and verification process for the `MAGBridge` contract on a specified Base network.

**Prerequisites**

-   **Hardhat Development Environment:** This script is built to run within a Hardhat project setup. Ensure you have Hardhat and its dependencies installed.
-   **Basescan API Key:** The automatic verification feature, obtain an Basescan API key and set it as an environment variable named `BASE_API_KEY`.

**Configuration**

-   **`relayerAddress` (Line 8):** Update this with the Base address of the account designated as the relayer (likely responsible for cross-chain communication). It is also available to add more relayers later on by going to contract on explorer and adding relayer through write proxy method (role bytes required). So, to get role bytes you can get in read proxy method.

**Execution**

1. **Deployment:**
    - Run the script from your terminal using:
        ```bash
        npx hardhat run ./scripts/deployment/deployMAGBridge.ts --network base
        ```

**Functionality**

1. **Initialization:**

    - Gets the deployer account from Hardhat.
    - Logs relevant deployment information (deployer address, target chain ID, relayer address).

2. **Deployment:**

    - Fetches the `MAGBridge` contract factory.
    - Deploys the contract as an upgradeable proxy using the OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin, passing the target chain ID and relayer address as constructor arguments.

3. **Address Saving:**

    - Stores the deployed contract address in a JSON file (`deploymentAddresses.json`) for future reference.

4. **Verification:**
    - If an Base API key is available, it attempts to verify the contract source code on Etherscan automatically. In case of error try to set new base api key or read the error. It also may say, that you need to change the name of the network base (example: from base -> baseMainnet).

**Output**

-   The script logs the following to the console:
    -   Deployment progress.
    -   Deployed contract address.
    -   Verification status (if applicable).
-   The deployed contract address is also saved to the `deploymentAddresses.json` file.

**Error Handling**

-   The script includes a basic `catch` block to log any errors that occur during deployment or verification.

**Key Points**

-   **Upgradeable:** This script deploys the `MAGBridge` contract as an upgradeable proxy, allowing for future upgrades if necessary.
-   **Customization:** You can easily adapt this script to deploy other contracts or modify the configuration for different networks or parameters.

## MAG Token deployment

-   FIRST TRY TO RUN SCRIPTS ON TESTNETS

**MAGToken Deployment Script (deployMAGToken.ts)**

**Purpose**

This script automates the deployment and verification of the `MAGToken` ERC20 contract on a specified Base network. It handles the calculation of a portion of the token supply for a bridge contract, deployment of the `MAGToken` contract, and verification on Basescan.

**Prerequisites**

-   **Etherscan API Key:** Obtain an Etherscan API key and set it as an environment variable named `BASE_API_KEY` to enable automatic verification.

**Configuration**

-   **`TOTAL_SUPPLY`:** Adjust this value if you want to modify the total supply of MAG tokens to be minted (default is 100,000,000 with 18 decimals). It is available to change total supply based on amount from all snapshots. So, it is recommended to make snapshots first.
-   **`testnetBridge` & `mainnetBridge`:** Update these variables with the correct bridge contract addresses for the respective networks (Base testnet and mainnet). So, if MAG bridge is not deployed yet, it must be deployed first, but if something went wrong you can grant bridge role to bridge later on base explorer.

**Execution**

1. **Preparation:**
    - Verify your Hardhat project setup and network configuration.
    - Set your `BASE_API_KEY` environment variable if you want automatic verification.
2. **Deployment:**

-   FIRST TRY TO RUN SCRIPTS ON TESTNETS

**Cross-Chain Bridge Setup Script**

**Purpose**

This script automates the setup process for the `NFTYBridge` and `MAGBridge` contracts on various Ethereum-compatible networks (ETH, Polygon, BSC, and Base) and their testnets. It specifically handles:

1. Whitelisting addresses.
2. Setting token allocations for whitelisted addresses.
3. Adding the bridged token to the bridge contract.

**Prerequisites**

-   **Deployment Addresses:** The script assumes you have already deployed the bridge contracts (`NFTYBridge` or `MAGBridge`) and their addresses are stored in variables.
-   **Snapshot Data:** The script requires JSON files (`tokenHoldersBsc.json`, `tokenHoldersEthereum.json`, `tokenHoldersPolygon.json`) containing wallet addresses and balances for the tokens to be bridged. These files are generated by snapshot scripts.

**Execution**

1. **Setup (Testnet or Mainnet):**
    - Run: `npx hardhat run ./scripts/setup.ts --network <your_network>`
    - Replace `<your_network>` with the appropriate network name (e.g., `sepolia`, `polygon`, `bscTestnet`, `baseSepolia`, `mainnet`, `base`, `polygonAmoy`).

**Functionality**

-   **`getStepsAmount()`:** Calculates the batch size for setting whitelist/allocations.
-   **`getBridgeAddresses()`:** Retrieves the correct bridge and token addresses based on the network.

**Key Points**

-   **Network Flexibility:** Handles setup on different Ethereum-compatible networks and their testnets.
-   **Batching:** Splits the whitelisting and allocation processes into batches to avoid exceeding block gas limits.
-   **Token Integration:** Adds the bridged token to the bridge contract, with a distinction between mock tokens for testnets and actual tokens for mainnet.
-   **Snapshot Data:** Relies on external snapshot files for the list of holders and their balances.

**Important Note:**

Ensure that the bridge contracts have been properly deployed.
